# Emojify

Emojify is a tool to turn your most prized sentences, paragraphs, songs, or poems into a timeless classic. The most prestigious form of art known to humankind. EmojiPasta.

This is a library that take's [notwaldorf](https://github.com/notwaldorf)'s [Emoji-Translate](https://github.com/notwaldorf/emoji-translate) project, and creates EmojiPasta'd text. A few changes are made to optimise it for songs or poems. All credit for the initial project goes to her.

Use `npm i emojify-lyrics` to install this into your application. To use, just import `import { emojify } from 'emojify-lyrics';` and pass it a block of text.
